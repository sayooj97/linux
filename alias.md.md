# alias.md
An alias in Linux is a shortcut or a custom command that allows you to execute a longer command or a series of commands with a shorter name. Aliases are often used to simplify frequently used commands or to create custom commands tailored to your workflow.

For example:
```bash
alias ll='ls -la'
```
This creates an alias `ll` that runs the `ls -la` command.

To make an alias permanent, you can add it to your shell configuration file, such as `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.
